# Inventory management system
Project demonstrated to show inventory management system. In this, the inventory is the donations to bloodbanks in form of monetory funds, food, books ect and we maintain the donor details as well.
To increase productivity of donation campaigns, I developed SQL queries to determine which city/area has the maximum donations at a particular time period for one perticular type of donation, total expenditure for each campaign, employee who has managed maximum number of drives

These SQL queries are in the DonationBizGoals.java file.
